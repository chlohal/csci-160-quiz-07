## Question 1: Insertion

### Time Complexity

This algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of $O(n^2)$, since it uses two nested `for` loops over the array.

### Space Complexity

This algorithm has an auxillary space complexity of $O(1)$, since it uses only 2 variables (besides loop counters), both of which are primitive integers.
